## About Me

Purpose/main focus of this project is having the visitor of the website answer 5 yes/no questions. 
The code needs to contain alerts and prompts to make it not only interactive, but to give the visitor feedback from the resposes they gave. The code also had to greet the visitor and have the enter their name, with an alert response back repeating it. Style and formatting were not a main focus, but <code><h1></code> was required to contain certain values and style.
