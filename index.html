    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I grew up in Norwich, Connecticut (CT) for majority of my life.<br>I enlisted into the Army when I was 24 which eventually brought me to Washington State (WA).<br>I'm a huge nerd when it comes to technology and video games, it's something I've always been fascinated with since I was a little kid.<br>I have 5 sisters (1 biological, 3 by marriage, and 1 adopted).<br>I love meeting new people and experiencing new things.</p>
    <h2>Education History</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2009 - High School Diploma from Norwich Free Academy (NFA)</li>
      <li>2012 - Associates Degree in General Studies and Science from Three Rivers Community College (TRCC)</li>
      <li>Pending, Nov 2022 - Certificate in Software Programmer from Code Fellows</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Job Experience</h2>
    <p>I have worked many jobs throughout my life, from working retail selling clothes, all the way to being a purchasing manager for an appliance repair buisness. Most of my job experience has been directly in Logistics and Supply Chain, about 9+ years total.<br>My proudest achievement was serving 6 years in the United States Army, I was attached to 1SFG(A) (First Special Forces Group (Airborne). If you don't know what the Airbone means, well, lets just say I jumped out of perfectly good aircrafts while they were flying.<br>My military job has let me visit and train in many places, these being: Japan, Mongolia, Thailand, and South Korea.</p>
    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
    <p>It would be very cool to one day bring my newly found, and soon to be, profecient coding skills to the supply chain sector. The feeling of knowing that the 9+ years I spent doing that wouln't just become irrelevant is a nice feeling to have. If not, I'm excited to let the coding path take me whever the wind blows.<br>I've wanted to code ever since I joined college back in 2010. It's nice to finally be pursuing something I've always wanted to do.
