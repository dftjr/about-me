    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I grew up in Norwich, Connecticut (CT) for majority of my life.<br>I enlisted into the Army when I was 24 which eventually brought me to Washington State (WA).<br>I'm a huge nerd when it comes to technology and video games, it's something I've always been fascinated with since I was a little kid.<br>I have 5 sisters (1 biological, 3 by marriage, and 1 adopted).<br>I love meeting new people and experiencing new things.</p>

    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
    <p>It would be very cool to one day bring my newly found, and soon to be, profecient coding skills to the supply chain sector. The feeling of knowing that the 9+ years I spent doing that wouln't just become irrelevant is a nice feeling to have. If not, I'm excited to let the coding path take me whever the wind blows.<br>I've wanted to code ever since I joined college back in 2010. It's nice to finally be pursuing something I've always wanted to do.
